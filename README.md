# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to our Machine Learning endeavor! Here, we delve into the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, expanding our skills and knowledge. This project presents both a challenge and a valuable learning opportunity, enabling us to explore concepts like supervised learning, feature engineering, and beyond, with the goal of mastering new techniques while solidifying our existing expertise.

## Project Details
Dataset: [Heart Attack Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/m1relly/heart-attack-prediction)

This dataset contains various health-related features, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with a target variable indicating the likelihood of a heart attack. It consists of real patient data collected from hospitals.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used:

1. Supervised Learning: We utilize supervised learning techniques to train our model using labeled data, where the target variable (likelihood of a heart attack) is known.
2. Feature Engineering: We perform feature engineering to select and transform relevant features from the dataset, enhancing the predictive power of our model.

## Key Findings:

1. Feature Importance: Through analysis, we identify key features that significantly influence the likelihood of a heart attack, providing insights into the underlying factors contributing to heart health.
2. Model Performance: We evaluate the performance of our Machine Learning model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its effectiveness in predicting heart attacks.
